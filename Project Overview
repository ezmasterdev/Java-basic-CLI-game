Game Title: "The Hero and the Princess".

Brief Summary:

This game is an original hard-coded basic CLI java game and is not a copy/modified version of someone else's work.
This game is a text-based adventure where the player(hero) rescues the princess from the dungeon deep inside the caverns.
The objective is to overcome the challenges by choosing the correct decisions.

We took inspiration from a list of possible simple CLI java games that chatGPT provided.
From there, we researched how we can program our very own text-based CLI game from scratch.

We feel that the code we came up with can still be polished for more efficient readibility.
However, as a group, we take pride in being able to come up with our own code and make it function the way we intended in such a limited time.
